\section*{Reproducibility statement}
We provide complete resources to ensure reproducibility of our results. The assumptions, definitions, and full proofs can be found in \cref{sec:inj} and \cref{app:preliminaries,sec:app:asinj,sec:app:trans} (analytic tools and model specification in \cref{app:preliminaries,sec:app:trans}; almost-sure injectivity and preservation under training in \cref{sec:app:asinj}; SIP-IT correctness, verifier, and margin analysis in \cref{sec:left-invertibility}). Implementation details for SIP-IT, including pseudocode, are provided in \cref{sec:inv} and \cref{alg:sipit-main} and further elaborated in \cref{sec:app:exp}. Our experimental setup (hardware and software versions) is described in \cref{sec:exps}, while dataset details and the prompt-sampling procedure for the 100k-prompt benchmark are given in \cref{sec:inj_res}. Finally, the supplementary materials include an anonymized code repository with end-to-end scripts, fixed seeds, configuration files, and a comprehensive README with step-by-step reproduction instructions.
